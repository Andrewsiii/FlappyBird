# FlappyBird_VHDL
This project is part of a mini project for Compsys 305. This project was made in collaboration with Andy Kweon and Phoenix Doolan.
## Implementation
This is a game based on the game flappy bird which was implemented using a DE0 board to be displayed on a VGA board.The design of our game is
created in key components such as the pipes which generate
the obstacles in the game and the mouse allows the user to
control the bird.
